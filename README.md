# Birthday-Countdown-App
Keep track of all your upcoming celebrations with just a few clicks using my Birthday countdown app. 
The Birthday Countdown App is a simple web application that counts down the time left for the next birthday or any important date. 
It also displays a message saying "Happy Birthday" if the current date matches the birthday date or if the countdown timer reaches zero.

In addition to the countdown feature, the app also includes a confetti library that creates a shower of particles when it's the user's birthday or when the countdown timer reaches zero.
